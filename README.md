What was achieved: 
Buy text field is getting updated real time based on the pay text field input.

Used: React.js, Material UI, Formik, Yup, react hooks

What was not achieved:

Converting crypto to currency is not available, only currency to crypto, that is why you cannot input values to buy text field.

Desing was not completed, it does not look like in figma file.

Could not fetch trader values from api because of cors policy, that is why I had to copy them in to a file.

The task was done in low quality because I had to learn everything from scratch (React, Formik, MaterialUI).
